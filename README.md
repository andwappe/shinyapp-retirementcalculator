# Retirement Contribution Calculator

This calculator lets you understand how much money you could accumulate if you were to make periodic contributions to your retirement accounts for a certain number of years, under a given set of assumptions. We can input an initial salary, rate of growth, contribution percentage, number of periods, years invested, annual rate of return, and target amount.

This app was created using R and the package shiny. I used tidyverse for data manipulation and graphics, plotly for web-interactive graphics, and DT to work with HTML table widgets.
